          <p>
            I have successfully completed several internships that have significantly enhanced my technical skills. Notably, I undertook virtual internships with <strong>TechSaksham</strong> and <strong>Eduskills</strong>, where I developed strong proficiency in <strong>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI/ML)</strong> and Android Development.<br/><br/>

            My first internship was a <strong>1-month program at CodSoft</strong>, where I worked on multiple Python-based projects. These included developing <strong>GUI-based applications</strong> such as calculators, a to-do list, and a quiz game, allowing me to strengthen my foundation in Python and user interface development.<br/><br/>

            My second internship was a <strong>2-month summer internship at Hackveda Limited</strong> üß†, where I worked on a project titled <strong>"Day Trade Light"</strong>. During this time, I applied various <strong>Machine Learning algorithms</strong> and performed <strong>data analysis</strong> tasks, such as analyzing the trade data of <strong>BOB Bank</strong> and visualizing insights using <strong>candlestick charts</strong>.

            I also contributed to building an <strong>automated email system</strong> using <strong>Google Crawler</strong> and <strong>SMTP</strong>. Throughout the internship, I worked with several technologies, including <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>, to deliver <strong>end-to-end web development solutions</strong>. Additionally, I helped create multiple data visualization charts using tools like <strong>SnakeViz</strong> üìä, enabling better performance profiling and analysis.

            This internship provided hands-on experience in full-stack development and collaborative teamwork with a group of talented and supportive colleagues, making it a truly enriching and memorable part of my learning journey.
